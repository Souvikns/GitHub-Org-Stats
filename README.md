### Development Workflow
We have two branches [main](https://github.com/Souvikns/github-org-stats) and [production](https://github.com/Souvikns/github-org-stats/tree/production). Let me tell you how we use our branches

- Main branch is where our development happens so you should always open a PR to this brach. This branch is hosted [here](https://github-org-stats-development.deta.dev/) for preview. As this is a development branch it could break or somethings should change drastically so don't use it for production. 
- Just as the name suggests production branch is used to deploy or production code. Most of the time this branch is behind the main branch in terms of commit. Once in two weeks we pull all the changes from the main branch to production branch so it might take some time to see your changes in the production build.
